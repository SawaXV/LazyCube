# LazyCube Deep Learning

Contains research scripts for both Detectron and Tensorflow for use in this project.

Directory format:

 - detectron - Demo scripts and data used to train detecton2 and d2go models (now deprecated work, Tensorflow is now favoured)
 - TFL - Demo notebooks and models from TensorFlow Lite tutorial demos/testing
    - `TFL_Training_Notebook.ipynb` - the primary Jupyter notebook used for model training (used with Google Colab)
 - docs - Documentation images used for the project's RoboFlow data set.


## Documentation

See the [wiki](https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/comp2002/2022-2023/team43_project/-/wikis/TensorFlow-Model-Docs) for documentation on running different scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the TFL model can be found in this [RoboFlow project](https://universe.roboflow.com/lazycube/lazycube).

Using the script below, documentation for adding the output to RoboFlow can be found in this [scribe doc](https://scribehow.com/shared/Pre-Annotated_Roboflow_Workflow__sO0tCsCSRhWa82gCN-Uzhw).

### Import to RoboFlow

Documentation to add the output from this script to our RoboFlow dataset can be found [here](https://scribehow.com/shared/Pre-Annotated_Roboflow_Workflow__sO0tCsCSRhWa82gCN-Uzhw).
